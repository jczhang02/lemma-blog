I work on numerical analysis and machine learning for partial differential equations, in particular **operator learning** for stiff reaction–diffusion systems, where the solution operator $\mathcal{G}: u_0 \mapsto u(\cdot, T)$ must be learned from few trajectories. Before that I studied spectral methods at [Northlake University](https://example.org).

I am on the job market in 2026.
